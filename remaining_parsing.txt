Parsing system : 

firstly look for parsing errors.

Spliting line into tokens.
(A token is delimited by a space, a separator or a newline).
Sepators are sepcial chars "\'\"&|$<>"

To implement : 

Parsing redirection tokens ("<<, >>"). Now it is only interpreting single ones.
Parsing quotes to check, having incorrect behavior with this line :
	{ ""''echo hola""'''' que""'' tal""'' };
+++DONE+++

Need to expand when '$' is present & !single_quotes.
	how??
	when $ found and needs to be expanded, create a new token, replacing $... by its exp value.
	copy what preceed the $ in a str, s join with exp value,
	then join these two str with what is remaining to parse and continue until EOL.
+++DONE+++

Need to join next token if there was no space in the command line
(ex: they were separated due to quotes inbetween but need to be joined back after).
